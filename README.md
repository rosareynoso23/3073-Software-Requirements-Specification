# Software-Requirements-Specification
This project exhibits a Software Requirements Specification document about a reatial company seeking to implement a mobile application to keep track of it's inventory. This document integrates the critical thinking, analysis, and requirements skills I learned in the Requirements Engineering and Analysis course. In this document, I detailed the specific requirements, limitations and constraints under which the software has to perform, and the intended verification approaches for the requirements. It is a detailed document about the software product.
